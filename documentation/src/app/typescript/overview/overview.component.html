<h1>Transport for TypeScript</h1>

<p>
    This implementation is designed to operate in the Browser (sorry node.js folks). However it is <strong>framework agnostic</strong>, and will work along-side any UI framework you want to implement.
</p>
<p>
    Most of this documentation is focused around using <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> as a UI framework, however we have added in a few React examples as well, just remember that thesd are just examples
    and Transport does not care which framework you would like to run. It's directly accessible from the <code>window</code> object, if you don't even want to use a framework.
