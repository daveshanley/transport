<h1>Initializing Transport</h1>

<p>
    The Java version of Transport depends on Spring. This makes it much, much simpler to build your applications using the bus.

<p>
    There isn't actually anything you need to do to initialize the Transport. It's self booting once you import the Jar into your Java Application.
