<h1>Using Private Channels</h1>
<p>
    The three ways to conduct direct messaging, as discussed in <a routerLink="/java/messaging">Messaging Types</a>,
    have one caveat; it uses a single WebSocket endpoint for both broadcast and direct messaging. The filtering mechanism is
    implemented on the client side.
    What this implies is that while the UI will not be able to see and process the response meant for another client's request
    with a different request ID, under the hood you can still see the message packet arriving at your browser using inspection tools.
    This could pose a security problem and might not be a feasible solution.
</p>
<p>
    With Transport, you can now set up 1:1 private channels between the broker and clients
    which ensures all communication between a client and the broker will always happen on a dedicated channel and other clients
    will not be able to see the message at all.
</p>
<p>
    See the following steps to configure and send to and receive from a private channel.

<h3>
    Configure Spring Boot to add a broker endpoint for private channels
</h3>
<p>
    Take MyConfiguration from <a routerLink="/java/configuring">Configuring Spring</a> as the starting
    point.  Here we want to 1) add a new endpoint <code class="clr-code">/queue</code> as the main endpoint for
    private conversations, and 2) configure a default handshake handler for the STOMP session.
    The handshake handler is responsible for generating and assigning a unique ID to each session.
</p>
<h3>MyConfiguration</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-java" ngNonBindable>// ...
    @Override
    public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) &#123;
        config.enableSimpleBroker("/topic", "/queue", "/pub");
        config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/pub");
    }

    @Override
    public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) &#123;
        registry.addEndpoint("/fabric")
                .setAllowedOrigins("*")
                .setHandshakeHandler(new DefaultHandshakeHandler() &#123;
                    @Override
                    protected Principal determineUser(ServerHttpRequest request,
                                                      WebSocketHandler wsHandler,
                                                      Map&lt;String, Object>&gt; attributes) &#123;
                        return new SessionPrincipal(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
                    }
                });
    }

    @Override
    public void registerTransportDestinationPrefixes(TransportBridgeConfiguration configuration) &#123;
        configuration.addTransportDestinationPrefixes("/topic", "/pub", "/user/queue");
    }
// ...
</code></pre>
<h3>Principal implementation example</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-java" ngNonBindable>public class SessionPrincipal implements Principal &#123;
    private String name;

    public SessionPrincipal(String name) &#123;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() &#123;
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) &#123;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>
    Then modify your service's <code class="clr-code">sendResponse()</code> and <code class="clr-code">sendError()</code>
</h3>
<p>
    See how <code class="clr-code">sendResponse()</code> in <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> of the
    <a routerLink="/java/building-services">Building Services</a> section accepts three arguments.
    The last argument describes the destination's session identifier so that the message or error message,
    in the case of <code class="clr-code">sendError()</code>, will reach its intended audience.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>
    And finally, mark the channel as private from the UI
</h3>
<p>
    <code class="clr-code">markChannelAsGalactic()</code> method accepts a channel name as the first required argument,
    and whether it's a private channel as the second, optional boolean value. By default it is set to false, meaning
    if you marked your channel without explicitly specifying that it should be a private channel, it would be a
    broadcast channel. See <a routerLink="/ts/extending-channels">Extending channels</a>
    as a reference. If you wanted to turn the servbot channel private, you would need to simply turn the following:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-ts" ngNonBindable>this.bus.markChannelAsGalactic('sergeant-fox');</code></pre>
<p>
    into this:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-ts" ngNonBindable>this.bus.markChannelAsGalactic('sergeant-fox', true);</code></pre>
<p>
    Try out the sample in multiple browser tabs and notice using your browser's inspect tools how each response is
    delivered only to the client that made the request.
