# Contributing to Transport

The Transport project (and all the various implementations) team welcomes contributions from the community. Together, we
can grow Transport and make it a better library and more useful for everyone.

Generally speaking, contributions fit into one or more of these categories:

- Reporting a bug or feature request see [Opening Issues and Reporting Bug Fixes](CONTRIBUTING_ISSUES.md).
- Implementation of a new feature and bug fixes, [Contributing to Code](CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPMENT.md).
- Documentation. See [Contributing to Documentation](CONTRIBUTING_DOCUMENTATION.md).

Every contribution is welcome.
